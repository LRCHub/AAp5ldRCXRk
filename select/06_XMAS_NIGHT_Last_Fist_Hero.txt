XMAS NIGHT
too young to face the fear that makes me sad
too old to run and hide under the bed
alone in this mess
in screams and broken glasses
I don’t remember what was right or wrong
I don’t remember if it was my fault
but I can’t lose interest
drowning into the darkness
I have lost my integrity in lies
cut you down to size
another Christmas nightmare no gifts under the tree
just a child with a broken heart that never gonna sleep
and while the blood flows slowly I think back to that lie
the promise of eternal love until the day we die
dinner is over and your face has been smashed to the ground as he takes a step closer with the barrel of
a gun in your mouth
over and over
family Is broken
my Life Is broken
so many craps inside my head
It’s hard to forget
